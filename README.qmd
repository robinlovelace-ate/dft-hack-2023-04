Notes from a hackathon.

# Reading a .pickle file

A starting point was files prepared for the event.
These were copied to the route of the project with bash as follows:

```{bash}
mkdir data
mv -v ~/Downloads/*.pickle data
```

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
# move all pickle files from ~/Downloads to ./data:
import os
import shutil
# Create the data directory if it doesn't exist:
if not os.path.exists('./data'):
    os.makedirs('./data')
for file in os.listdir('~/Downloads'):
    if file.endswith('.pickle'):
        shutil.move(os.path.join('~/Downloads', file), './data')
```

We can list the pickle files as follows:

```{python}
import os
# List pickle files in route directory:
for file in os.listdir('data'):
    print(file)
```


```{python}
import pickle
# Read the first pickle file:
with open('data/AA_example_links.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    links = pickle.load(f)
```

Show what's in the links object

```{python}
print(links)
```
